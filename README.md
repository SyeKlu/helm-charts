# Helm Chart Repository

This repository contains a collection of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts for deploying applications on Kubernetes. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps in managing applications by packaging them into charts, which can be versioned, shared, and deployed easily.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the charts in this repository are currently in alpha version and are not recommended for use in production environments.

## Prerequisites

To use the charts in this repository, you need to have Helm installed on your machine. Refer to the official Helm documentation for [installation instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Usage

To use a chart from this repository, you first need to add the repository to your Helm installation:

```bash
helm repo add <repo-name> <repo-url>
```

Once you've added the repository, you can search for available charts:
